DHCP Protocol is used to assign IP addresses. 
It is present in router and it is also used in  Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and etc.

- Docker:  By default, the container is assigned an IP address for every Docker network it connects to. The IP address is assigned from the pool assigned to the network, so the Docker daemon effectively acts as a DHCP server for each container.
